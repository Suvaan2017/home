    <h1 class="text1">PAW DARSHAN NEPAL</h1>
    <P class="p1">In Nepal, animal shelters play a crucial role in rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming abandoned and stray animals,
    primarily dogs and cats. Many animals in Nepal are left to survive on the streets due to neglect, lack of awareness, and
    misconceptions about breed value.
    Why Are So Many Animals Abandoned?
    One of the biggest challenges in Nepal is the abandonment of dogs and cats simply because they are not "good breeds."
    Many people prefer expensive, foreign breeds like Labradors, German Shepherds, or Huskies, considering them a status
    symbol. As a result, native Nepali breeds and mixed-breed animals are often seen as less desirable. When families
    realize that purebred dogs require high maintenance or when street puppies and kittens grow up and lose their "cute"
    appeal, they are often abandoned.
    Additionally, many pets are left on the streets when owners move, face financial struggles, or are unable to care for
    them due to lack of veterinary access. Stray animals also face mistreatment, accidents, and starvation, leading to a
    harsh and painful existence.
    Our company does:<BR>
    - [ ] Saves abandon stray pets<BR>
    - [ ] Feed the animals<BR>
    - [ ] Find good homes<BR>
    - [ ] Make sure they have a home and are well feed.</P>

        So, imagine our neighborhood is super clean, and people’s houses and offices look great because of a cleaning
        company. But outside, things can get really messy. Have you ever noticed how some rivers, ponds, or places with water
        look dirty? There’s trash floating in the water, and sometimes the water looks brown or polluted. That’s not good for
        the animals living there, and it’s not healthy for people either.
        In many places, people throw trash into rivers because they don’t know where else to put it. And when it rains, all the
        garbage goes into the rivers, making them dirty and unhealthy. These rivers are important because they give us water to
        drink, water for plants, and water for animals. But when the water is dirty, it can make people sick, and animals lose
        their homes. Plus, it looks really bad and doesn't make the environment feel nice.
        That’s where our cleaning company comes in! While we clean houses and offices, we also care about keeping our
        environment clean. Our company will be the one that helps clean the rivers and other places that get really dirty. Just
        like other cleaning companies clean homes, we ,safe nepal sends teams to clean up the trash from the rivers and
        beaches, making the water clean again.
        We use special machines to pick up trash, and we work with the community to stop people from throwing
        garbage in the first place. We teach everyone about how important it is to keep our rivers clean and protect our
        planet.
        If we don’t clean the rivers and protect the environment, things could get worse. The dirty water could spread diseases,
        and animals could be in danger. By having a cleaning company like ours, we could be heroes, making sure people’s homes,
        and the whole planet, stay clean and safe for everyone to enjoy.
        We all need to help take care of the world around us, not just our homes.
